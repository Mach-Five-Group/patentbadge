The use of a Patent Badge may be used at any time following issuance of a patent.

More than any other procedure, PCX "promotes the progress of science" by allowing for the streamlined and transparent trading of patent licenses in order to quickly distribute technology. Further, PCX helps secure for patentees the exclusive right to monetize their discoveries as provided under Article 1, Sec. 8, Clause 8 of US Constitution.</p></div></div></details><details class=faq-item aria-expanded=false><summary aria-label="How Does Transparency of PCX Transactions Promote Distribution of Technology?">How Does Transparency of PCX Transactions Promote Distribution of Technology?</summary><div class=faq-content><div class=faq-content-inner><p>The stock market is proof that pricing must be publicly available, so that equities may be traded.

A patent grants patentee the right to exclude others from practicing the technology claimed by such patent. But in order to settle most disputes over patents, parties frequently execute license agreements that allow both parties to continue using the patented technology in exchange for royalties that are paid by licensee to patentee. PCX streamlines such licensing negotiations by issuing a Patent Badge that attempts to bring the parties together on pricing and other terms.</p></div></div></details><details class=faq-item aria-expanded=false><summary aria-label="What Terms Do Patent Licenses Need to Have?">What Terms Do Patent Licenses Need to Have?</summary><div class=faq-content><div class=faq-content-inner><p>Patent licenses include the following terms: Parties affected, patents covered, geographical scope, exclusivity, term of coverage, termination, audit rights, patent marking, licensing fee and description of technology licensed.

Provisional application must include a specification and figures (if applicable), but need not contain claims. The priority date for all material covered in a provisional application is the filing date of the provisional application. A provisional application lapses 1 year after the filing date. During this 1 year period, a non-provisional application claiming the benefit of the provisional application may be filed by the applicant. Provisional patent applications are not examined by the PTO.

For example, an application may contain one set of claims describing a novel structure for a device and another set of claims describing novel methods for fabricating the device. In these cases, the examiner issues a restriction requirement, which requires the applicant to choose between the sets of claims as to which set the examiner will search and examine in the originally filed application, and the non-elected claims that are not examined and considered in the application. The applicant has the option to file divisional applications for each group of non-elected claims. The divisional application has the same priority date and specification as the original application, but contains a group of non-elected claims from the original application. If prosecution of the original and divisional applications is successful, separate patents will issue --one for the original application and one for each divisional application.</dd></div><div><dt style=font-weight:700;color:var(--navy);margin-bottom:.25rem>Continuation Application</dt><dd style=margin:0;color:var(--ink)>A patent application based on an earlier filed patent application where there is no new disclosure, but which may contain different claims.

A CIP consists of a specification and claims. The specification must describe the originally filed invention and the newly disclosed portion of the invention, and the claims correspond to the newly disclosed material. The originally filed material has a priority date corresponding to the date of filing of the original application, but the newly disclosed material has a priority date that corresponds to the date of filing of the CIP.</dd></div><div><dt style=font-weight:700;color:var(--navy);margin-bottom:.25rem>PCT</dt><dd style=margin:0;color:var(--ink)>Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) is an international patent law treaty providing a unified procedure for filing patent applications to protect inventions in each of its contracting countries and regions.

Most patents have 20 claims (appended to the last pages of a US patent document). Claims define the extent of coverage which is conferred by the patent. Each claim consists of a single sentence describing an object, apparatus, or method which is covered by the patent. There are two basic types of claims: independent claims and dependent claims. An independent claim is a stand-alone claim, while a dependent claim follows or depends from one or more claims and narrows the scope of any claims from which it depends.</dd></div><div><dt style=font-weight:700;color:var(--navy);margin-bottom:.25rem>Prior Art</dt><dd style=margin:0;color:var(--ink)>Body of public knowledge.
